    "    - These are kept in UTC for now as my travels spanned across multiple timezones.\n",
    "    - Some activities had to be reviewed manually to set the start and end dates.\n",
    "    - Checks were done by comparing the activity coordinates manually on google to confirm what the best datetime to be used.\n",

    "- Google Maps Timeline\n",
    "    - Data is divided into 4 types - Visits, Activities, Timeline Paths, and Timeline Memory\n",
    "    - **Visit**: Usually stores when you have been static on the map for a while, unsure how this works fully as it tends to capture highway stops but misses some restaurant visits. Connectivty could be a factor.\n",
    "    - **Activity**: While movement is detected, google tries to predict if you were driving, walking, cycling, etc. This provides info on strat and end coordinates along with distace - so speed is a factor used to determine activity type. Again bad connectivity could factor in for error.\n",
    "    - **Timeline Paths**: While activities only store the start and end coordinates along with their time, Timeline Paths store a dictionary of coordinates between those times to give a full picture of points visited usually captured at a frequency of few minutes.\n",
    "    - **Timeline Memory** - My data contained very little of these for me to make any concrete definition for them and they have not been used in the analysis.\n",
    "- Each row in JSON data can depict either of the above types and need a check to fill in an NA values to make their identification easier.\n"
